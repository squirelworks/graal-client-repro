# Graal 2.3 (GNW14015)

A first rebuild of the classic Graal 2.3 client in Delphi (Object
Pascal). It is a windowed program: it opens on a start screen with
Training, the server list from the listserver, and login. This is version
0.0.1, an early reproduction: it plays, logs in and walks, but it has not
yet been compared with the original, and some of what it sends is a
stand-in until the original program has been studied.

These zips hold no original Graal code, graphics, sounds or levels. The
program carries small default graphics and a starter level of its own, so
it runs as it is. Put it in the folder of a 2.3 install you own, next to
its files, or keep those files in a `graal-assets/` folder beside it.

## Downloads

| Zip | Runs on | Window |
|---|---|---|
| `…-linux.zip` | Linux x86-64 | X11 |
| `…-windows.zip` | Windows, 32-bit | GDI |

Each zip has `Graal230` (the client) and the build's README. The test
programs are built and run on every release but no longer shipped.

On Windows the first start may show **"Windows protected your PC"**. That
is SmartScreen meeting an unsigned program it has not seen before, not a
virus warning. Either click **More info**, then **Run anyway** (once), or
unblock the zip before you extract it: right-click it, **Properties**,
tick **Unblock**, **OK**. Then nothing in the folder is asked about again.
See [Windows says "Windows protected your PC"](https://github.com/squirelworks/graal-delphi#windows-says-windows-protected-your-pc).

## What works

- The start screen: nick name, Training, Start. Start fetches the server
  list (the install's `arrays2.dat`, or `listserver.txt` next to the
  program, else `listserver.graal.in:14922`), then account, password and
  Connect.
- Login with the `GNW14015` version token.
- Full-precision positions of players and NPCs.
- The board, the player and other players, walking and collision, level
  links, gmaps and walking over their edges.
- S sword, A lift / throw / open, D weapon, Q item list, M map; items,
  bombs, hearts, death and respawn; signs; level NPCs and their scripts;
  baddies; sound effects.
- A headless mode for stress runs.

## Not yet

The client's own tamper check bytes (a stand-in is sent), the original
start window, the F1 window, Options, chat, NPC movement messages, UDP.
See the build's README for the full list.

## Checks behind this release

The test suite runs with range and overflow checks and the heap tracer
and ends with no unfreed memory. CI logs two clients into seihai-gserver,
has the second see the first, and walks one through a level link.
